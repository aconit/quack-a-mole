# Quack-a-mole
Quack-a-mole is a modern version of "whack-a mole" where a quantum computer decides whether to show a mole or not.
More about the game you can read on http://quack-a-mole.com/Home/Info

To run the code don't forget to insert your own IBM Q API token (https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/account) in the _token variable of the GameController. You will need to have or create an IBM Q account to be able to get the token.

Special thanks go to Kevin Casey (https://developer.ibm.com/author/kcasey/) and his Shell Game (http://nanoquantumshellgame.azurewebsites.net/) as his code helped to create communication with the IBM Q API.
